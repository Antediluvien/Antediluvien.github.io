Hypothesis:
Does Latitude of a location have correlation to other parameters such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness and windspeed?

Thought process:
How do I best show these possible correlations for a user to easily understand?  For this I chose to utilize a website layout which indicates the data points on a graph that can easily show how latitudinal ranges of data correlate to the respective parameters of temperature, humidity, cloudiness and windspeed.

Data set:
Was provided by USC Data Analytics, which was pulled from Open Weather API.
